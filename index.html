    <p>Subject: Request for Deadline Extension for Cohort 2</p>
    <p>Dear DCS Support Team,</p>

    <p>I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to request an extension of the deadline for Cohort 2, currently set for November 16.</p>

    <p>Due to the recent pause from October 22 to November 1, which we were not informed about beforehand, the time allocated to complete the program has effectively been reduced by six days. This unforeseen change has impacted the momentum of our Study Jams, as re-engaging participants has been slower than anticipated.</p>

    <p>To ensure the best possible experience for all participants and to maximize the program's impact, we kindly request that you extend the deadline by a reasonable amount of time. This will allow us to meet the cohort's objectives without disappointing our participants.</p>

    <p>Thank you for considering this request. We look forward to your support in making Cohort 2 a success.</p>

    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>[Position]<br>[College]<br>[Name]</p>
